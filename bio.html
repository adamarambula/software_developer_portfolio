            <p>Hi, I'm Adam.<p><br>
                <p>Here's a glimpse into my journey.</p><br>
                <p>Following over five years of military service, 
                    where I honed skills in communication, time management, 
                    and critical thinking, I embarked on a new path, delving into a Business degree. 
                    It was during this period that my passion for programming emerged.
                <p><br>
                <p>Seeking entry into the IT industry, 
                    I pursued QA automation, leading me to enroll 
                    in an intensive Software Development Engineer 
                    in Test boot camp. Here, I deepened my understanding 
                    of the Software Development Life Cycle and testing methodologies.
                </p><br>
                <p>However, it was during my exploration of API security testing
                    that my curiosity soared. Unveiling the 
                    intricacies beneath the surface, I found 
                    myself captivated by system dynamics. Driven by 
                    this newfound passion, I intensified my self-learning 
                    journey, with a clear aim to transition into a developer role.
                </p><br>
                <p> Continuing to expand my horizons, I've delved into 
                    various online courses, focusing on enhancing my skills 
                    as a software developer. I've gained proficiency in languages 
                    such as Java, Python, Javascript, and mastered tools like Spring Boot,
                    HTML, and CSS.
                <p><br>
                <p>Presently, I'm enrolled in a full-stack developer program, 
                    equipping myself with the requisite skills for future success.
